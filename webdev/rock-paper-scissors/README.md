## Rock - Paper - Scissors Game

Let's play a game of rock - paper - scissors.

- `rock` beats `scissors`
- `scissors` beats `paper`
- `paper` beats `rock`

When the user clicks on the button `rock`, `paper` or `scissors` the computer randomly chooses one of the three options, we then update the score board and display a message showing who won the round.
